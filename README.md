The article talks about a partnership between two AI firms, G42 and Microsoft, to address ethical use of AI. G42 is an Abu Dhabi based AI company, known for having the Falcon LLM, the largest LLM model in the middle east, and one of the largest in the world. It is intersting to see global firms cooperate to address the ethical concerns of LLM: Socially, politically and economically.
